            <div class="p"><p><h3>First of all, looking at Mt. Fuji is the same as looking at Alishan in Taiwan. You have to choose the season to see it. Yamanashi Prefecture once made statistics in 2019 to sort out which days you can clearly see Mt. Fuji every day of the year. It turned out that Autumn to winter is the best time to see Mount Fuji.</h3></p></div>

            <div class="p"><p><h3>The so-called inverse Fuji means that the entire Mount Fuji is reflected on the calm lake, showing the opposite Mount Fuji. To take pictures of the inverse Fuji, it is recommended that the best time to take pictures of the inverse Fuji is in the early morning, and you need to cooperate with the days with no rain, no snow, and no wind to take pictures.</h3></p></div>

            <div class="p"><p><h3>But if there is a slight breeze, it may not be possible to take pictures of the inverse Fuji. It is possible that your inverse Fuji is hazy like an oil painting.</h3></p></div>
